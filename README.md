# Divide and Conquer Assignment

## Overview
This project is part of Assignment 1 for the course *Design and Analysis of Algorithms*.  
The goal is to implement classic divide-and-conquer algorithms, collect performance metrics, and analyze their complexity.

## Implemented Algorithms
- MergeSort (divide and conquer, Master Theorem Case 2)
- QuickSort (randomized pivot, smaller-side recursion)
- Deterministic Select (Median of Medians)
- Closest Pair of Points (O(n log n))

## Metrics
The project tracks:
- Number of comparisons
- Memory allocations
- Maximum recursion depth
